This is lesscss-ant-task, an Apache Ant task for converting LessCSS files to
regular CSS files.

For more information about LessCSS, see:

   http://lesscss.org/

This Ant task has been tested with the following combination of software:

   - J2SE 5.0 and Java SE 6 (source code uses Java 5.0-features)
   - Ant 1.7.1
   - lessc 1.1.13
   - plessc 0.1.6

This Ant task supports 2 distinct LessCSS interpreters:

   1. 'lessc'  - The official interpreter from http://lesscss.org/.
                 Ruby-based, performance is moderate.

   2. 'plessc' - LessPHP, an alternative implementation from
                 http://leafo.net/lessphp/
                 PHP-based, performance is good.

This software is available under the terms of a BSD-style license, see
the accompanied LICENSE file.

This task comes as a collection of Java source files that can be built with Ant.
Just run:

   ant

The result will be a JAR file:

   build/lesscss-ant-task.jar

Example usage of the task in an Ant build file:

   <taskdef name="lesscss"
       classname="com.pensioenpage.jynx.lesscss.LessCSSTask"
       classpath="lib/lesscss-ant-task.jar" />

   <lesscss dir="src/htdocs" todir="build/htdocs" />

Although all parameters are optional, the task supports various:

   dir      - the source directory, to read LessCSS files from, defaults to
              the project base directory;

   todir    - the destination directory, to write the generated CSS files to,
              defaults to the source directory;

   command  - the command to execute, by default the task uses 'lessc', but
              in the future it may become more intelligent and possibly find
              'plessc' as well, possibly even preferring that over 'lessc';

   timeOut  - the time-out in milliseconds for executing a single command,
              defaults to 60000 (meaning 60 seconds);

   includes - the files in the source directory to include, defaults to
              '*.less';

   excludes - the files to exclude, even if they are matched by the includes;

and other parameters inherited from the MatchingTask, see:
